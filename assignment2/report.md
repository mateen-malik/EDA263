Here we use the software Thunderbird as our mail client. The reasons that we use it is because it is easy to use and already combined with the gpg key so that we can directly encrypt our message through the Thunderbird's interface.

Hsin-Kai Chen: I think I won't use it in the future since that most of my friends are not computer science students. It is too hard for them to decrypt my message using gpg. We don't care about the security of our message that much. But if I want to encrypt my own file, I will consider to use it since it is safer.
